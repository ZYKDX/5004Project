Fixed-Size QR Code Generator

This project uses Java GUI.

Information encoding:
    
    int[][] DATA = new int[29][29];
    29*29 2D binary int array of 0 and 1
    0 -> white pixel    1 -> black pixel
    
    To encode information:
          position detection pattern, timing pattern, alignment pattern
          Mode indicator. character count indicator, encode the information(using selected mode)
          Error correction coding

The visualization is a JFrame which has 2 parts:
  part 1: uses a JTextField to receive message from the user. 
          The message is a string of Upper Case letter, lower case letter, number, and some symbols
          length of the string is limited to 53 (determined by the size and EC level of the QR code: 3L)
  part 2: uses a 29*29 grid layout filled with 841 JPanels
          set the background of the JPanels to Color.BLACK or Color.WHITE
