Project:  Fixed-Size QR Code Generator
    Shu Xu, Yukun Zhou

Project Description: This project has 2 parts - QR code generator and user interface. 
    The user interface is based on Java GUI, receives user input, and displays the generated QR code.
    The QR code generator is based on Java, gets the user input, and encode the entered information following QR code specifications.
    The program will ask for a user input (a string up to 53 characters long), and display a 29*29 QR code.
    By scanning the generated QR code, user input will be read by the scanner (a mobile phone or ipad)

Information encoding:
    int[][] DATA = new int[29][29]   <->   29*29 2D binary int array of 0 and 1
                                           0 -> white pixel    1 -> black pixel
    To encode information:
          position detection pattern, timing pattern, alignment pattern
          Mode indicator. character count indicator, encode the information(using selected mode)
          Error correction coding

The visualization is a JFrame which has 2 parts:
  part 1: uses a JTextField to receive message from the user. 
          The message is a string of Upper Case letter, lower case letter, number, and some symbols
          length of the string is limited to 53 (determined by the size and EC level of the QR code: 3L)
  part 2: uses a 29*29 grid layout filled with 841 JPanels
          set the background of the JPanels to Color.BLACK or Color.WHITE
