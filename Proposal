    25*25 2D binary int array of 0 and 1
    0 -> white pixel    1 -> black pixel
    
    To encode information:
          position detection pattern, timing pattern, alignment pattern
          Mode indicator. character count indicator, encode the informatioon(using selected mode)
          Error correction coding
